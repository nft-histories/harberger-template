# Harberger Template

## What is Harberger Tax?

I first read about this concept (here)[https://0xfoobar.substack.com/p/on-royalties] and (here)[https://dzone.com/articles/harberger-taxes-on-ethereum]. I'll attempt to summarize it here.

- asset owners evaluate the value of their asset as they will (they can change the evaluation at any time)
- asset owners pay taxes based on that evaluation (a percentage set by the tax authority)
- the tax authority can claim the asset if the owner doesn't pay the tax in a timely manner
- any other entity can purchase the asset from you at that evaluation (decentivizes owners from undervaluing their asset to do tax evasion)
- whenever a new owner purchases the asset, he has a safe period of time to re-evaluate the asset

## How to use this template?

You can either fork this repo (hardhat project) or use the template feature of Github.

In the future we aim to `npm publish` the template as well.
